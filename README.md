# Pokemon_Predictor
Machine Learning for predicting Pokemon based on status (e.g. HP, attack, defence).

# Dependancies
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas 
- pickle

## Generate csv file of random pokemon data 

To generate a random dataset with "Pokemon of Interest", run the following commmand: 

`python data_generator.py`


## How to train a model 

To train the model on the csv file, run the following command: 

`python trainer.py`

## Predictions 

TODO: Finish writing this section

`python predictor.py`

## Future steps
- Add type as feature using label encoding and one hot encoding
- Use different machine learning classifiers (K-nearest Neighbour)
